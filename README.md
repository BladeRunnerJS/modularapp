# A Modular Application that Scales

This application is used as part of the **How to Build Front-End Web Apps that Scale** workshop.

Due to the `WEB-INF` folder having been checked in this app works with [BladeRunnerJS only](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/releases/tag/v0.7). If you wish to use it with a different version of BRJS, run `scripts/replace-webinf.sh modularapp` to replace the existing `WEB-INF` folder.
